=== 💖 WELCOME! 

I'm Cate. At the present, I'm working on becoming a backend developer specializing in functional programming. I've always wanted to become one but time, among many things, wasn't on my side. Now I can finally pursue my interest because I'm graced with a very supportive presence in my life—my partner.

=== 📜 ROADMAP

Because I only have limited financial resources, I thought of taking the informal route that is being self-taught right from the start. I'm grateful of how the programming community can be incredibly supportive to the newcomers and the experienced programmers alike.

Years down the road, I'm thinking about learning the following programming languages: Haskell, Clojure, F# for .Net and Scala.

I found this link:https://roadmap.sh/backend[Modern Backend Developer Roadmap]. Thank you so much link:https://stars.github.com/profiles/kamranahmedse/[@kamranahmedse]. The roadmap will serve as my guide throughout this seemingly intimidating and exciting journey.
