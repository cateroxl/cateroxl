=== 💖 WELCOME! 

I'm Cate. At the present, I'm working on becoming a backend developer specializing in functional programming. I've always wanted to become one but time, among many things, wasn't on my side. Now I can finally pursue my interest because I'm graced with a very supportive presence in my life—my partner.

=== 📜 JOURNEY

Because I only have limited financial resources, I thought of taking the informal route that is being self-taught right from the start. I'm grateful of how the programming community can be incredibly supportive to the newcomers and the experienced programmers alike.
