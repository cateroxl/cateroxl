=== 💖 WELCOME! 

I'm Cate. At the present, I'm working on becoming a backend developer. I've always wanted to become a functional programmer but time, among many things, wasn't on my side. Now I can finally pursue my interest because I'm graced with a very supportive presence in my life—my partner.

=== 📜 ROADMAP

Because I only have limited financial resources, I thought of taking the informal route that is being self-taught right from the start. I'm grateful of how the programming community can be incredibly supportive to the newcomers and the experienced programmers alike.

I found this link:https://roadmap.sh/backend[Modern Backend Developer Roadmap]. Thank you so much link:https://stars.github.com/profiles/kamranahmedse/[@kamranahmedse]. The roadmap will serve as my guide throughout this seemingly intimidating and exciting journey.
